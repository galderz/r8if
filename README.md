- [ ] Deal with return of awaitTerminalEvent
- [x] Each test should clear the cache when it finishes (symmetry) and wait for it
- [x] Cache client in SingleNode test suite
- [ ] Create an API test where we show how to stop a cache and wait for it returning last operation result
- [x] Verify calls are lazy and follow the sequence
- [x] Allow individual tests to be run starting only server(s) needed for that test
- [ ] Enable running suites from command line
- [ ] Set up travis
- [ ] Log complete messages after the async operation within lambda (avoid capturing external vars)
- [ ] Test: putAll and clear
- [ ] RxClient.createMap
- [ ] RxMap.putAll
- [ ] RxMap.replace
- [x] RxMap.remove
- [x] RxMap.clear
- [x] RxMap.putIfAbsent
- [x] RxMap.put

- [x] RxMap factory
- [?] ~RxMap.getAll~ / No getAllAsync in Infinispan's AsyncCache, query more important
